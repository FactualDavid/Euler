# Euler
Project Euler is a HTML/CSS Theme I built for my current website, www.davidnhuang.com

#### Overview
I designed Euler to be a descriptive theme. As a designer, I'm more comfortable describing an object as a way to define it. Therefore, euler's CSS has a bunch of little 'descriptions' like left, right, padding top, etc, all used to help me describe how the element should behave. This resulted in a faster and hackable theme for me.
